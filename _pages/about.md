Theoretical hadron physics, hadron spectrum, hadronic interactions, effective field theories, and lattice QCD

## Introduction

I (L. Meng) was born in 1992 in Shandong, China. Since beginning my PhD, I have been studying hadron physics — with a focus on exotic states such as tetraquarks and pentaquarks. My research aims to uncover patterns in these exotic hadrons to better understand non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)— especially the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and color confinement.Although I am a theoretical physicist, I strongly favor close integration with the latest experimentalresults (e.g. those from the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider and the Large Hadron Collider experiments at CERN) and lattice QCD simulations (a numerical approach solving QCD numerically on a spacetime grid). Recently, I also begun exploring applications of deep learning in my research (AI4Science). 

## Publications
I have published over 50 papers with citations over 2,000 times(h-index 29),and six papers each cited more than 100 times.
